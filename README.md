# New_Faker_Locale
During our bootcamp cohort one of our classmates had particularly memorable quotes.  I turned them into a faker locale for unit testing, or placeholder seed info.

For use with the Faker ruby gem.

Deployment instructions:

  * locate your faker gem folder.
      In your command terminal you can find the path by entering
      $ gem which faker

  * copy the zeke.yml file into the /lib/locales/en folder

  * enjoy!
